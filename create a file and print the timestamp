The file_date function creates a new file in the current working directory, checks the date that the file was modified, 
and returns just the date portion of the timestamp in the format of yyyy-mm-dd.


import os
import datetime

def file_date(filename):
  # Create the file in the current directory
  dest_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)
  with open (filename,'w') as file:
    pass
  timestamp = os.path.getmtime(filename)
  # Convert the timestamp into a readable format, then into a string
  c = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)
  # Return just the date portion 
  # Hint: how many characters are in “yyyy-mm-dd”? 
  return ("{}".format(c.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")))

print(file_date("newfile.txt")) 
# Should be today's date in the format of yyyy-mm-dd
