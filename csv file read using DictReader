Question 1
We're working with a list of flowers and some information about each one. The create_file function writes this information to a CSV file. 
The contents_of_file function reads this file into records and returns the information in a nicely formatted block.

  import os
import csv

# Create a file with data in it
def create_file(filename):
  with open(filename, "w") as file:
    file.write("name,color,type\n")
    file.write("carnation,pink,annual\n")
    file.write("daffodil,yellow,perennial\n")
    file.write("iris,blue,perennial\n")
    file.write("poinsettia,red,perennial\n")
    file.write("sunflower,yellow,annual\n")


# Read the file contents and format the information about each row
def contents_of_file(filename):
  return_string = ""

  # Call the function to create the file 
  create_file(filename)

  # Open the file
  with open(filename) as f:
    csv_f = csv.DictReader(f)
    # Read the rows of the file into a dictionary
    for row in csv_f:
      return_string += "a {} {} is {}\n".format(row["color"], row["name"], row["type"])
  return return_string


#Call the function
print(contents_of_file("flowers.csv"))
